In today's manufacturing landscape, material waste represents one of the most significant opportunities for cost reduction and environmental impact improvement. Enter **SmartCut** - an intelligent visual system that's revolutionizing how manufacturers handle production waste through automated measurement, classification, and inventory management.

## What is SmartCut?

SmartCut is an advanced AI-powered visual system that utilizes specialized camera technology with LED lighting to precisely capture the shape, size, and area of material remnants on production line output tables. The system automatically creates material polygons, evaluates usable areas, and compares them against predefined, configurable utilization parameters.

## Core System Components

### 1. Visual Scanning System

- **Industrial high-resolution camera** optimized for manufacturing environments
- **LED lighting system** specifically designed for various materials like wood, plastic, and metal
- **Overhead mounting** above output tables like CNC or saw stations
- **Advanced edge detection** and shadow contrast recognition

### 2. AI + Geometric Processing Engine

The heart of SmartCut combines artificial intelligence with sophisticated geometric algorithms:

- **Shape and edge recognition** - automatic 2D polygon creation
- **Area calculation** and shape complexity analysis
- **Parameter comparison** including:
  - Minimum usable area dimensions
  - Shape suitability for future applications
- **Classification output**: categorizes remnants as suitable/unsuitable/conditionally suitable

### 3. Database & Inventory Management Module

Comprehensive tracking system that records:

- **Unique remnant ID**
- **Timestamp and production line data**
- **Dimensions, area, material type, and usability status**

Advanced features include:

- Filtering by type and dimensions
- Production planning integration
- Time-based utilization tracking

### 4. API Integration

Seamless connectivity through RESTful API with:

- **ERP systems** like SAP, Helios, and Navision
- **MES Manufacturing Execution Systems**

Key functionalities:

- Production plan and preferred dimension loading
- Remnant usage reporting back to main systems
- Automated waste limit alarms

## Analytics & Reporting Capabilities

SmartCut provides comprehensive insights through:

### Daily/Weekly/Monthly Reports

- Number of generated remnants
- Percentage of usable offcuts
- Material savings quantification
- Waste trends by production type and material

### Visual Dashboards

Integration with popular analytics platforms like Power BI and Grafana for real-time monitoring and historical analysis.

## Optional Enhancement Modules

- **RFID or QR code remnant tagging**
- **Robotic sorting and storage systems**
- **Cut planning integration** - utilizing remnants in new designs

## Proven Benefits
